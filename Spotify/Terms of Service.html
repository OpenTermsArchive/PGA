<h1><a id="1-introduction" href="#1-introduction"></a><a></a>1. Introduction</h1>
<p>Please read these Terms of Use (these "<strong>Terms</strong>") carefully as they govern your use of (which includes access to) Spotify's personalized services for streaming music and other content, including all of our websites and software applications that incorporate or link to these Terms (collectively, the "<strong>Spotify Service</strong>") and any music, videos, podcasts, or other material that is made available through the Spotify Service (the "<strong>Content</strong>").</p>
<p>Use of the Spotify Service may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented by Spotify, which are hereby incorporated by this reference into these Terms.</p>
<p>By signing up for, or otherwise using, the Spotify Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, then you must not use the Spotify Service or access any Content.</p>
<p>THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 6 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR ANY OTHER COURT PROCEEDINGS, OR CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.</p>
<h2><a id="service-provider" href="#service-provider"></a><a></a>Service Provider</h2>
<p>These Terms are between you and <u>Spotify USA Inc</u>, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, NY, 10007.</p>
<h2><a id="age-and-eligibility-requirements" href="#age-and-eligibility-requirements"></a><a></a>Age and eligibility requirements</h2>
<p>BY USING THE SPOTIFY SERVICE, YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OR OLDER TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS, OR, IF YOU ARE NOT, THAT YOU ARE 13 YEARS OR OLDER AND HAVE OBTAINED PARENTAL OR GUARDIAN CONSENT TO ENTER INTO THESE TERMS. Additionally, in order to use the Spotify Service and access any Content, you represent that: you reside in the United States, and any registration and account information that you submit to Spotify is true, accurate, and complete, and you agree to keep it that way at all times.</p>
<h1><a id="2-the-spotify-service-provided-by-us" href="#2-the-spotify-service-provided-by-us"></a><a></a>2. The Spotify Service Provided by Us</h1>
<h2><a id="spotify-service-options" href="#spotify-service-options"></a><a></a>Spotify Service options</h2>
<p>We provide numerous Spotify Service options. Certain Spotify Service options are provided free-of-charge, while other options require payment before they can be accessed (the "<strong>Paid Subscriptions</strong>"). We may also offer special promotional plans, memberships, or services, including offerings of third-party products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties.</p>
<h2><a id="trials" href="#trials"></a><a></a>Trials</h2>
<p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a "<strong>Trial</strong>"). By using a Spotify Service via a Trial, you agree to the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/premium-promotional-offer-terms/"><u>Spotify Premium Promotional Offer Terms</u></a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#"></a><a></a></h2>

<h2><a id="service-limitations-and-modifications" href="#service-limitations-and-modifications"></a><a></a>Service limitations and modifications</h2>
<p>We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service operational and to provide you with a personalized, immersive audio experience. However, our service offerings and their availability may change from time to time, without liability to you; for example:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The Spotify Services may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or testing, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements.</li>
 <li>We aim to evolve and improve the Spotify Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all of part of the Spotify Service (including particular functions, features, subscription plans, and promotional offerings);</li>
 <li>Spotify has no obligation to provide any specific content through the Spotify Service, and Spotify or the applicable owners may remove particular songs, videos, podcasts, and other Content without notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have prepaid fees directly to Spotify for a Paid Subscription that Spotify permanently discontinues prior to the end of your Pre-Paid Period (as that term is defined in the <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/end-user-agreement/#s4"><u>Payments and cancellations</u></a> section below), Spotify will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. Your account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you.</p>
<p>Spotify has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.</p>

<h2><a id="creating-a-spotify-account" href="#creating-a-spotify-account"></a><a></a>Creating a Spotify account</h2>

<h3><a id="billing" href="#billing"></a><a></a>Billing</h3>
<p>You may purchase a Paid Subscription directly from Spotify or through a third party either by:</p>
<ul>
 <li>paying a subscription fee plus applicable taxes in advance on a monthly basis or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase; or</li>
 <li>pre-payment giving you access to the Spotify Service for a specific time period ("<strong>Pre-Paid Period</strong>").</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax rates are calculated based on the information you provide and the applicable rate at the time of your monthly charge.</p>
<p>If you purchase access to a Paid Subscription through a third party, separate terms and conditions with such third party may apply to your use of the Spotify Service in addition to these Terms. Please contact the third party regarding any refunds or to manage your subscription. If you purchase a Paid Subscription using a code, gift card, pre-paid offer, or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Spotify for access to a Paid Subscription ("<strong>Codes</strong>"), you hereby agree to the Spotify <a href="https://www.spotify.com/legal/gift-card/"><u>Card Terms</u></a>.</p>
<h3><a id="price-and-tax-changes" href="#price-and-tax-changes"></a><a></a>Price and tax changes</h3>
<p>Spotify may from time to time make changes to Paid Subscriptions, including recurring subscription fees, the Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid), or Codes, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change and, by continuing to use the Spotify Service after the price change takes effect, you will have accepted the new price. If you do not agree to a price change, you can reject the change by unsubscribing from the applicable Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect.</p>
<p>Tax rates are based on the rates applicable at the time of your monthly charge. These amounts can change over time with local tax requirements in your country, state, territory, county, or city. Any change in tax rate will be automatically applied based on the account information you provide.</p>
<h3><a id="renewal-and-cancellation" href="#renewal-and-cancellation"></a><a></a>Renewal and Cancellation</h3>
<p>With the exception of Paid Subscriptions for a Pre-Paid Period, your payment to Spotify or the third party through which you purchased the Paid Subscription will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. Contact our Customer Support team <a href="https://support.spotify.com/us/contact-spotify-support/?_ga=2.242801345.2113527512.1615794512-1876599584.1615794512"><u>here</u></a> for instructions on how to cancel. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the free version of the Spotify Service. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partial subscription periods, except as expressly stated in these Terms.</p>
<p>If you have purchased a Paid Subscription using a Code, your subscription will automatically terminate at the end of the period stated with your Code, or when there is an insufficient pre-paid balance to pay for the Spotify Service.</p>

<h3><a id="governing-law-and-jurisdiction" href="#governing-law-and-jurisdiction"></a><a></a>Governing law and jurisdiction</h3>
<p>These Terms are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States of America, without regard to California's choice or conflicts of law principles. Further, you and Spotify agree to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Northern California, California, to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy that relates to or arises in connection with these Terms or the Spotify Service that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement below, and waive any jurisdictional, venue or inconvenient forum objections to such courts.</p>
<h3><a id="arbitration-agreement" href="#arbitration-agreement"></a><a></a>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
<p><em>This Arbitration Agreement section sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which disputes, claims and controversies between you and Spotify will be resolved through arbitration ("Arbitration Agreement").</em></p>
<h3><a id="dispute-resolution-and-arbitration" href="#dispute-resolution-and-arbitration"></a><a></a>Dispute resolution and arbitration</h3>
<p>You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Terms or to your relationship with Spotify as a user of the Spotify Service (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator must follow these Terms and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees and costs only where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.</p>
<h3><a href="#"></a><a></a></h3>
<h3><a id="exceptions" href="#exceptions"></a><a></a>Exceptions</h3>
<p>You and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to bring an individual action (1) in a U.S. small claims court or (2) in a court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section above, seeking (a) only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator or (b) public injunctive relief, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from the arbitrator. In addition, this Arbitration Agreement doesn't stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
<h3><a id="no-class-or-representative-proceedings-class-action-waiver" href="#no-class-or-representative-proceedings-class-action-waiver"></a><a></a>No class Or representative proceedings; class action waiver</h3>
<p>YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.</p>
<h3><a href="#"></a><a></a></h3>
<h3><a id="arbitration-rules" href="#arbitration-rules"></a><a></a>Arbitration rules</h3>
<p>Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>") then in force (the "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at <a href="https://adr.org/"><u>adr.org</u></a>.</p>
<p>Any arbitration hearings will be conducted by phone or videoconference to the extent possible, but if the arbitrator determines that a hearing should be conducted in person, the locale for such hearing shall be determined by the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p>If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and you are required to pay a filing fee, Spotify will reimburse you for that filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US $10,000, in which case you will be responsible for the filing fee. Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA Rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
<h4><a href="#"></a><a></a></h4>
<h3><a id="notice-process" href="#notice-process"></a><a></a>Notice; process</h3>
<p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by electronic mail to <a href="mailto:legal@spotify.com"><u>legal@spotify.com</u></a> and by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required) to the address below ("<strong>Notice</strong>"). Spotify's address for Notice is: Spotify USA Inc., Attn: General Counsel, 4 World Trade Center, 150 Greenwich Street, 62nd Floor, New York, New York 10007, USA. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought ("<strong>Demand</strong>"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify's last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of the arbitrator's decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.</p>
<h3><a id="enforceability" href="#enforceability"></a><a></a>Enforceability</h3>
<p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole or in part, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the 'Governing law and jurisdiction' section above shall govern with respect to any aspect of any dispute, claim or controversy that, as a result of such invalidation, is no longer governed by this Arbitration Agreement.</p>

If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and may be brought in court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"#arbitration-rules\" id=\"arbitration-rules\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003eArbitration rules\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEither you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (\"\u003cstrong\u003eAAA\u003c/strong\u003e\") then in force (the \"\u003cstrong\u003eAAA Rules\u003c/strong\u003e\"), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above).

Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA Rules or court order. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"#notice-process\" id=\"notice-process\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003c/a\u003eNotice; process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by electronic mail to \u003ca href=\"mailto:legal@spotify.com\"\u003e\u003cu\u003elegal@spotify.com\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and by certified mail, Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required) to the address below (\"\u003cstrong\u003eNotice\u003c/strong\u003e\").

During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, and the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Spotify's last written settlement offer, then Spotify will instead pay you either the amount of the award or $1,000, whichever is greater.
