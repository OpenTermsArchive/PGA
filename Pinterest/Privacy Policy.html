This log data includes, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (like the “Save” button) browser type and settings, and the date and time of when you accessed the Services.

For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest.

When you’re on our Services, we use your activity—such as which Pins you click on, terms you search for, boards you create, and any text that you add in a comment or description—along with other information you’ve provided when you first signed up and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer you are a travel enthusiast. We may also infer other information, such as your education or professional experience.&nbsp;</li><li slot="65ce44ec5f9ea4.37838276"><strong>Location Information</strong>: We use your IP address to infer your approximate location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location, and photos you share may include information about the location where they were taken.</li><li slot="65ce44ec5f9ea4.37838276"><strong>User Choices</strong>: We will keep a record of choices you’ve selected in your settings, including privacy settings and whether you have enabled notifications.</li></pin-list>

<p>Because Pinterest is a worldwide service, we may transfer the personal data of EEA, Switzerland, and UK residents to a country outside the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK. Where we transfer information from the EEA, Switzerland, or the UK to a country that doesn't provide an adequate level of protection, we’ll only do so under appropriate safeguards to protect your information.</p>

<p>Safeguards which we rely on in ensuring your information benefits from an adequate level of protection includes the following: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adequacy decisions. These are decisions issued from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (or equivalent decisions under other laws) where they recognise that a country offers an adequate level of data protection. We transfer your information as described in “<a href="https://policy.pinterest.com/privacy-policy#section-how-we-use-the-info-we-collect">How we use the info we collect</a>” to some countries with such adequacy decisions, such as the countries listed <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/article/adequacy-decisions">here</a>; or&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Standard contractual clauses (“<strong>SCCs</strong>”). The European Commission has approved contractual clauses under Article 46 of the GDPR that allows companies in the EEA to transfer data outside the EEA. These (and their approved equivalent for the UK and Switzerland) are called standard contractual clauses. We rely on standard contractual clauses to transfer information as described in “<a href="https://policy.pinterest.com/privacy-policy#section-how-we-use-the-info-we-collect">How we use the info we collect</a>” to certain entities in our family of companies and third parties in countries without an adequacy decision.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>While transfers to countries that don’t have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of SCCs, in certain circumstances, transfers can also take place on the basis of exemptions provided under data protection law. For example, sharing with law enforcement, in emergency situations where we learn that a person’s life is at risk.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use:</p>

<ul>
	<li>technical protections, such as encryption and pseudonymisation; and&nbsp;</li>
	<li>policies and processes to challenge disproportionate or unlawful government authority requests.</li>
</ul>
