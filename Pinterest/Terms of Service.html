For the purpose of these Terms, anything that you post or otherwise make available on Pinterest is referred to as "User Content." You retain all rights in, and are solely responsible for, the User Content you post to Pinterest. All User Content must comply with these Terms and our policies, including our <pin-link type="primary" linkurl="https://policy.pinterest.com/community-guidelines" arialabel="Community Guidelines" active="1" theme="policy">Community Guidelines</pin-link>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will only post User Content that you have the rights to post, and you won’t post User Content that infringes the intellectual property rights of others (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement or counterfeit), or that is otherwise unlawful, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law. We can take action against User Content that violates these Terms or our policies or where we are permitted or required by law, such as by removing, restricting, or limiting access to, or distribution of, the content. We can also suspend or terminate accounts of users who repeatedly or seriously infringe third-party intellectual property rights, violate the law, these Terms, or our policies, or where permitted or required to do so by law. We are a neutral intermediary and we do not review all User Content before or after it is published on the Service, so we are not responsible or liable to any third party for the content or accuracy of any User Content posted by you or any other Pinterest user. For more information about how we enforce our policies or otherwise take action on content on Pinterest, see our <pin-link type="primary" linkurl="https://policy.pinterest.com/enforcement" arialabel="Enforcement page" active="1" theme="policy">Enforcement page</pin-link>. Where appropriate, you may appeal the decisions you think were made in error. You may have a right under local law to bring a claim for breach of contract if you believe we have breached these Terms by removing, restricting or limiting access to, or distribution of, your User Content, or suspending or terminating your account. Pinterest cannot provide you with legal advice.</p>

            <div><p>If you are a consumer in the EEA or United Kingdom (UK), Section 11 doesn't apply to you.</p>
<p>For any dispute you have with us, you agree to first contact us and try to resolve the dispute informally. To the extent permitted by law, neither party may initiate any legal proceeding—whether in court, arbitration, or any other forum—until the Notice of Dispute and Informal Dispute Resolution processes described below are completed. Nothing in this Section, however, will prevent either you or us from seeking temporary injunctive relief in court (or in arbitration) to preserve the status quo or to help enforce this arbitration clause at the outset of any dispute.</p>
<p>A party with a dispute must first send us a Notice of Dispute, which must include your full name; your Pinterest profile name (which begins @); the email address associated with your Pinterest account; your country of residence and, if you are a U.S. resident, your state of residence; your counsel, if you are represented by counsel; a detailed description of both the dispute and the alleged harm; and your signature. That information should be emailed to <span class="spamspan"><span class="u">litigation</span> [at] <span class="d">pinterest.com</span><span class="t"> (litigation[at]pinterest[dot]com)</span></span>. The notice can only be sent on behalf of an individual party; a Notice of Dispute that asserts the rights of more than one party is ineffective. After receiving the Notice of Dispute, Pinterest will respond within 60 days to attempt to resolve the dispute amicably. After the 60-day period has elapsed, either party may initiate arbitration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Arbitration</strong></u>: If we haven’t been able to resolve the dispute through the mandatory processes above, you and we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service through binding arbitration or, for qualifying claims, in small claims court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitration is a more informal way to resolve our disagreements than a lawsuit in court. By accepting these Terms, you agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section, and that you and Pinterest are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitrator also has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the applicable rules then in effect for the AAA. If the AAA rules conflict in any way with these Terms, the Terms will govern. You can find AAA’s forms at <pin-link type="primary" linkurl="http://www.adr.org" arialabel="www.adr.org" active="1" theme="policy">www.adr.org</pin-link>. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. A judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Where the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules apply, if the arbitrator determines that a party’s claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, the arbitrator must assign all fees and costs associated with the arbitration to that party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All disputes must be brought in the party's individual capacity, and not as a member in any class or representative proceeding. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</p>
<p>Nothing in these Terms shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that apply to you. To the extent any dispute isn’t arbitrable under applicable laws or otherwise, you agree that the dispute will be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section 12 of these Terms.</p>
<p><u><strong>Batched Arbitration</strong></u>: To provide a more efficient arbitration process, you and we each agree that if 50 or more similar arbitration demands are filed within a 60-day period or with the assistance of the same law firm or group of law firms, AAA will consolidate the arbitration demands. For each batch, AAA will administer one set of filing and administrative fees per side, per batch, and AAA will appoint one arbitrator to resolve each batch as a single consolidated arbitration. Arbitration demands are similar if they arise from similar facts and raise similar legal issues while seeking similar relief. Any dispute about similarity will be submitted to a single arbitrator, whose fees will be paid by us.</p>
