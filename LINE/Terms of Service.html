<p><span>10.9. If LINE believes that a User has violated or may violate any applicable laws or regulations or the provisions of these Terms and Conditions in relation to the Submitted Contents, or when otherwise reasonably necessary for LINE&rsquo;s business, then LINE reserves the right to preclude such User's use of the Services in certain manners, such as deleting the Submitted Contents without providing prior notice to the User.</span></p>

<p><span>11.2. Coins may not be exchanged or used for cash, property or other economic gain other than the services and Contents designated by LINE.
