Arbitration, Class-Action Waiver, and Jury Waiver</div><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE THAT YOU AND SNAP AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND INCLUDE A CLASS ACTION WAIVER AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER. This Arbitration Agreement supersedes all prior versions.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">a. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. In this Section 19 (the “Arbitration Agreement”), you and Snap agree that all claims and disputes (whether contract, tort, or otherwise), including all statutory claims and disputes, arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of the Services or any communications between you and Snap that are not brought in small claims court will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, except that you and Snap are not required to arbitrate any: (i) disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is an individual dispute and not a class action, (ii) disputes or claims where the only relief sought is injunctive relief, and (iii) disputes in which either party seeks equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. To be clear: the phrase “all claims and disputes” also includes claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of these Terms. In addition, all disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">b. Informal Dispute Resolution First. We want to address any disputes without needing arbitration. If you have a dispute with Snap that is subject to arbitration, then prior to initiating arbitration, you agree to mail an individualized request (“Pre-Arbitration Demand”) to <span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>, ATTN: Litigation Department, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405 so that we can work together to resolve the dispute. A Pre-Arbitration Demand is valid only if it pertains to, and is on behalf of, a single individual. A Pre-Arbitration Demand brought on behalf of multiple individuals is invalid as to all. The Pre-Arbitration Demand must include: (i) your name, (ii) your Snapchat username, (iii) your name, telephone number, email address and mailing address or the name, telephone number, mailing address and email address of your counsel, if any, (iv) a description of your dispute, and (iv) your signature. Likewise, if Snap has a dispute with you, Snap will send an email or text message with its individualized Pre-Arbitration Demand, including the requirements listed above, to the email address or phone number associated with your Snapchat account. If the dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days of the date that you or Snap send your Pre-Arbitration Demand, arbitration may then be filed. You agree that compliance with this subsection is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement or ADR Services’ Rules, the party against whom an arbitration has been filed has the right to seek a judicial declaration in court regarding whether the arbitration should be dismissed for failure to comply with the informal dispute resolution process set forth in this subsection.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">c. Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act, including its procedural provisions, governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision, and not state law. If, after completing the informal dispute resolution process described above, you or Snap wishes to initiate arbitration, the arbitration will be conducted by ADR Services, Inc. (“ADR Services”) (<a href="https://www.adrservices.com/?lang=en-GB" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">https://www.adrservices.com/</a>). If ADR Services is not available to arbitrate, the arbitration will be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM") (<a href="https://www.namadr.com/?lang=en-GB" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">https://www.namadr.com/</a>). The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of this arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount sought is less than $10,000 USD may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount sought is $10,000 USD or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the arbitral forum’s rules. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">d. Additional Rules for Non-appearance Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, written submissions or any combination of the three; the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">e. Fees. If Snap is the party initiating an arbitration against you, Snap will pay all costs associated with the arbitration, including the entire filing fee. If you are the party initiating an arbitration against Snap, you will be responsible for the nonrefundable Initial Filing Fee. If, however, the amount of the Initial Filing Fee is more than you would have to pay to file a Complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (or, for cases where that court would lack original jurisdiction, the California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles), Snap will pay the difference between the Initial Filing Fee and the amount you would have to pay to file a Complaint in Court. Snap will pay both parties’ Administrative Fee. Otherwise, ADR Services sets forth fees for its services, which are available at <a href="https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/?lang=en-GB" target="_blank" class="sdsm-hyperlink css-1ekngtg" rel="noopener">https://www.adrservices.com/rate-fee-schedule/</a>.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">f. Authority of the Arbitrator. The arbitrator will decide the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Snap. The dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under law, the arbitral forum’s rules and the Terms. The arbitrator will issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Snap.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">g. Settlement Offers and Offers of Judgement. At least ten (10) calendar days before the date set for the arbitration hearing, you or Snap may serve a written offer of judgment on the other party to allow judgment on specified terms. If the offer is accepted, the offer with proof of acceptance shall be submitted to the arbitration provider, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within thirty (30) calendar days after it is made, whichever is first, it shall be deemed withdrawn and cannot be given as evidence in the arbitration. If an offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party fails to obtain a more favourable award, the other party shall not recover their post-offer costs and shall pay the offering party’s costs (including all fees paid to the arbitral forum) from the time of the offer.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">h. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND&nbsp;SNAP&nbsp;WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and&nbsp;Snap are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Snap over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND SNAP WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and instead elect to have the dispute resolved by a judge.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">i. Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. This subsection does not prevent you or Snap from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Arbitration Agreement of ADR Services' Rules, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION THAT IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">j. Right to Waive. Any rights and limitations set out in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver will not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">k. <b>Opt-out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor Snap can force the other to arbitrate. To opt out, you must notify Snap in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions. Your notice must include your name and address, your Snapchat username and the email address you used to set up your Snapchat account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. You must either mail your opt-out notice to this address: <span dir="ltr">Snap Inc.</span>, Attn: Arbitration Opt-out, 3000 31st Street, Santa Monica, CA 90405, or email the opt-out notice to arbitration-opt-out @ snap.com.</b></p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">l. Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Snap may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p">m. Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Snap, including any revocation of consent or other action by you to end your participation in the Service or any communication with Snap.</p><p class="css-1go7wjq sdsm-p"><i>In summary: Unless you exercise your right to opt out, Snap and you will resolve all claims and disputes first through an informal dispute resolution process and, if that does not resolve the issue, on an individual basis using binding arbitration. This means that you cannot bring a class action suit against us in the event of a claim or dispute.</i></p></div></div></div></div></section><section data-test-id="sdsm-content" class="sdsm-content css-ygoydk"><div data-test-id="sdsm-content-header-and-body" class="css-1bwj8xn"><div data-test-id="sdsm-content-body"><div class="css-rre4k5" data-test-id="sdsm-content-body-content" data-animation-id="content-body"><div data-test-id="mwp-rich-text" class="css-is8b0c"><div class="sdsm-h2 css-4kkhu7">20.
